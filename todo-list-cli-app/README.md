# TO-DO List CLI application with Node.js

This is a basic to-do list application that can be built upon to add more custom functions

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node.js version 10.15.3(and above)
A code editor IDE
Git and Github
Installation of all dependencies as stated in the package.json file
A command-line interface (Git bash or windows cmd etc.)
```

### Installing

First clone the repository from https://github.com/chordzz/Wejapa.
Then open your command-line interface and navigate to the folder that contains the "index.js" file.

Next Open the package.json file and install the dependencies as stated in the file by running
```
npm install --save dependencyName1 dependencyName2 
```
This installs the dependencies needed to run your CLI app

After installing your dependencies, your CLI app is ready to run.
Give it a spin by running the following command in the Command-line

```
node index.js
```
On getting the first prompt, type in ```addTodo``` press enter, then type in any task to your to-do list. When added run ```node index.js ``` again, on getting the prompt this time, type in ```listTodos```. A list of all the tasks on your to-do list will be shown.
